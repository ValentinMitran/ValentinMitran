## Hi there 👋  
###  Welcome to my profile :octocat:

My name is Valentin and I'm a Full stack developer. Not gonna lie, I love coding. Actually, I feel sick if I go more than 3 days without coding. Yes, I even code when I'm on vacation.

- :office_worker: I’m currently working at UNDISCLOSED as a Full stack developer, using the MERN stack and react native for mobile development.
- 💻 I’m probably coding at the moment.
- 😄 Fun fact, when I used to work as a back end developer with PHP I hated Javascript, but now....oh boy...I love Js!
